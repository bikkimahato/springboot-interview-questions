## Spring Boot Basic Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an open-source framework developed by Pivotal Team (part of VMware) which is used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications by providing a range of non-functional features commonly used in applications (such as embedded servers, security, and metrics) out of the box.

**Example:**
```java
// Sample Spring Boot Application
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 2. What are the main features of Spring Boot?

- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures your Spring application based on the dependencies you have added.
- **Standalone**: Standalone applications that can be run from the command line.
- **Embedded Server**: No need for deploying WAR files, embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, etc.
- **Production Ready**: Metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
- **Spring Boot Starters**: Set of convenient dependency descriptors to quickly set up a Spring-based project.
- **Spring Boot CLI**: Command-line interface for creating and deploying Spring Boot applications.

**Example:**
```java
// Auto-Configuration Example
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
public class MyAutoConfigurationApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyAutoConfigurationApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 3. Explain the Spring Boot architecture.

Spring Boot architecture is built on top of the Spring Framework. It follows the layered architecture pattern which includes:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles the HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.
- **Repository Layer**: Deals with database operations.
- **Integration Layer**: Integrates with other services or APIs.

Spring Boot uses the following key components:
- **Spring Core**: Provides dependency injection.
- **Spring MVC**: Provides model-view-controller architecture.
- **Spring Data**: Provides easy data access.
- **Spring Security**: Provides authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Boot Auto Configuration**: Automatically configures application based on dependencies.

**Example:**
```java
// Service Layer Example
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}

// Controller Layer Example
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {
    private final MyService myService;

    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting() {
        return myService.getGreeting();
    }
}
```

### 4. What is the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a combination of three annotations:
- `@Configuration`: Indicates that the class has `@Bean` definition methods.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.
- `@ComponentScan`: Enables component scanning so that the web controller classes and other components you create are automatically discovered and registered as beans in Spring's application context.

**Example:**
```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 5. How does Spring Boot simplify dependency management?

Spring Boot simplifies dependency management by providing a set of "starter" dependencies. These starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application to get a pre-defined set of libraries.

**Example:**
```xml
<!-- Maven POM Example -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

With this starter, you get all the necessary dependencies for building a web application, including Spring MVC, Jackson for JSON binding, and an embedded Tomcat server.

#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 6. What are Spring Boot Starters and how do they help in development?

Spring Boot Starters are dependency descriptors that can be added to your project to include a set of dependencies. They help in rapid development by reducing the need for manually specifying dependencies in your build configuration.

**Example:**
```xml
<!-- Spring Boot Starter for JPA -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- Spring Boot Starter for Web -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 7. Explain the concept of "convention over configuration" in Spring Boot.

"Convention over configuration" is a design paradigm used by Spring Boot to reduce the number of decisions a developer has to make. It provides default configurations based on the context and dependencies of the application, which can be overridden if necessary.

**Example:**
When you add `spring-boot-starter-web` to your project, Spring Boot assumes you want to create a web application and automatically configures Tomcat as the default server.

#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 8. How can you create a Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr?

Spring Initializr is a web-based tool provided by Spring to bootstrap a new Spring Boot project. You can select the dependencies and download the project as a ZIP file.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
2. Select project metadata (Group, Artifact, etc.).
3. Choose dependencies you want to include.
4. Click "Generate" to download the project.

#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 9. What is the difference between the `application.properties` and `application.yml` files?

Both `application.properties` and `application.yml` are used for configuring Spring Boot applications. The main difference lies in their format:
- **application.properties**: Key-value pairs.
- **application.yml**: YAML format, which is more readable and supports hierarchical data.

**Example:**
```properties
# application.properties
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
```

```yaml
# application.yml
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
```
#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-basic)**
---

### 10. How do you define a custom configuration in Spring Boot?

You can define custom configurations in Spring Boot by creating a class annotated with `@Configuration` and defining beans within it.

**Example:**
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class MyCustomConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyService` is a custom bean that is defined in the configuration class.

## Spring Boot Core Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. What are the main features of Spring Boot and how does it simplify development compared to the traditional Spring framework?
Spring Boot is designed to simplify the development of Spring-based applications by providing a range of features that streamline configuration and deployment. Some of its main features include:

- **Auto-configuration**: Automatically configures Spring applications based on the dependencies present in the classpath.
- **Embedded Servers**: Comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, reducing the need for complex server configurations.
- **Spring Boot Starters**: Provide a set of convenient dependency descriptors to simplify Maven or Gradle configuration.
- **Spring Boot CLI**: Allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications from the command line.
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Provides production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and more.
- **Externalized Configuration**: Supports externalized configuration via `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.
- **DevTools**: Enhances the development experience with features like automatic restarts and live reloads.

### Example
Here's a simple Spring Boot application:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

### 2. Explain the concept of auto-configuration in Spring Boot. How does it work and how can you customize it?
Auto-configuration is a key feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added. It eliminates the need for explicit configuration in many cases.

### How it works
Spring Boot scans the classpath for libraries and uses predefined configuration classes to set up beans and other components automatically. The `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation (implicitly included in `@SpringBootApplication`) triggers this behavior.

### Customizing Auto-Configuration
You can customize auto-configuration using configuration properties or by defining custom beans. If you need to exclude specific auto-configurations, you can use the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation with the `exclude` attribute.

### Example
To exclude a particular auto-configuration class:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration;

@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MySpringBootApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 3. What are Spring Boot Starters and how do they help in building Spring Boot applications?
Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors you can include in your application. They provide a curated set of dependencies for specific functionalities, making it easier to set up a new Spring Boot application.

### Example
To create a web application, you can add the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

This starter includes dependencies for Spring MVC, Jackson for JSON processing, and an embedded Tomcat server.

#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-core)**
---

### 4. How does Spring Boot handle externalized configuration? Explain the role of `application.properties` and `application.yml`.
Spring Boot allows you to externalize your configuration so that you can work with the same application code in different environments. This is done using `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.

### Example
`application.properties`:
```properties
server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret
```

`application.yml`:
```yaml
server:
  port: 8081
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: root
    password: secret
```
#### **[â¬† Back to Top](#level--spring-boot-core)**

## 5. What is Spring Boot Actuator? What are some of the key endpoints provided by Actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features for Spring Boot applications, such as monitoring and management capabilities. It includes endpoints that allow you to interact with your application and gather various metrics and information.

### Example
To enable Actuator, add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Key Endpoints
- `/actuator/health`: Provides information about the application's health status.
- `/actuator/info`: Displays arbitrary application information.
- `/actuator/metrics`: Exposes various metrics about the application.
- `/actuator/env`: Displays properties from the `Environment`.
